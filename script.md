## Introduction

Hi, this is the Diente group and welcome to our ToothFlex user test. Our ToothFlex app offers a unique way for users to be able to keep track of their brushing history so that the habit of brushing regularly is always present. We really appreciate you being here as you play a really important role in our app development. Today we will be walking through the test together.  
Before we begin, it is very important to note that we’re testing the app, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don’t have to worry about making mistakes. 
As you use the app, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us. Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve it, so we need to hear your honest reactions.  If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know. 
With your permission, we’re going to record what happens on the screen and our conversation. The recording will only be used to help us figure out how to improve the app, and it won’t be seen by anyone except the people working on this project. And it helps me, because I don’t have to take as many notes. 

## Background Questions

We presume you are a user who normally is familiar with web apps and have a little bit of dental health knowledge (at least the knowing that you should brush your teeth to keep your dental health in check.) 
  - What kind of mobile device (or devices) do you use, like smartphones or a tablet? 
  - What kinds of things do you spend time doing on your mobile devices? 
  - Do you have any favorite mobile app and if so, what about it makes it your favorite app?

## The Test
1.	Reactions to the homepage – Go to the ToothFlex homepage and tell us your general impression of the site. What makes it stand out to you? Are you tempted to click on anything? Is it clear to you what all the elements are page are for?
2.	General tasks - Now I’m going to ask you to try doing some specific tasks. I’m going to read each one out loud and we’re going to try to get through all these tasks if time permits us.
  -	Our app tracks brushing history using a timer and stores it once finished. Could you start the timer on the app?
  -	As mentioned before, the brushing history is only stored once the user finishes brushing. Could you stop the timer?
  -	Could you reset the timer to its original form?
  -	Are you able to figure out where the brushing history is stored?
  -	Are you able to go to the profile page and edit your profile picture?
  - Could you try editing your profile name and username?
  -	Our application allows its users to set brushing goals. Could you set the frequency and duration of your brushing time?
  -	It's easy to forget to brush your teeth sometimes and reminders could help with that. Are you able to turn on notifications?
3.	Final observations – Do you have any final observations on the site? Would you consider using it?

Thank you so much, once again, for your willingness to help us test our new ToothFlex app. The web app is rather new, so we appreciate your help in fixing it up. We’ll contact you soon with a summary of what we found and how we hope to use it to improve the site. We’ll keep the data from your individual session private and will only release aggregate data.
